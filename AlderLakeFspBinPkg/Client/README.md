# AlderLakeFspBinPkg/Client

These FSP binaries are intended to be used with client SKUs of the 12th Generation Intel® Core™ processors and chipsets formerly known as Alder Lake.

## &#x1F534;Deprecated&#x1F534;

Intel recommends migrating all systems with 12th Generation Intel® Core™ processors and chipsets (formerly known as Alder Lake) from AlderLakeFspBinPkg to RaptorLakeFspBinPkg. The latter is fully backward compatible with the former. As of now, AlderLakeFspBinPkg is no longer actively maintained. For the latest improvements, we recommend transitioning to RaptorLakeFspBinPkg.

AlderLakeFspBinPkg has been replaced with a symbolic link to RaptorLakeFspBinPkg. The original AlderLakeFspBinPkg remains available in the Git history if needed.
